BUGS:
* Prevent saving notes when there is no record to save it to. This currently
  fails silently.

TODO:
* Add the application state to the database.
  * records not saved
  * current customer and vendor
* When a sale or purchase is committed, then the accounts are updated.
* Inventory is automatically updated when a sale is made. (TODO)
* Put new sales and purchases in the menu, rather than trying to code up
  new forms
* Add progress dialogs for database stuff.
* Add backup/restore for customers and vendors.
* Add reports to menus
* Show balance sheet and P&L on "home" tab
* Add support for a form on a dialog. Differentiate a notebook tab form
  and a dialog form by adding new base classes with overrides.
* Decide how to support added logic in a notebook form.
* A customer or vendor cannot be deleted if there are committed
  transactions associated with them.
* If a customer or vendor can be deleted, then also delete uncommitted
  transactions as well.
* A customer of vendor can be modified, as long as committed transactions
  are not disturbed. Committed amounts cannot be altered.
* Associate vendors with accounts. This is used as the default account when
  committing a transaction. The account can be changed when the purchase
  is committed.
* Figure out a way to show uncommitted sales and purchases.
* Figure out a way to avoid duplicating sales and purchases when importing.
* Modify product widget so that additional products are selected from a
  non-modal dialog, then displayed in the form.
* Select sales or purchases based on the customer/vendor name. Select dialog
  needs to show if there are uncommitted transactions for that entity.
* Select sales and vendors based on whether they have uncommitted transactions.
* Add better directory and discovery for the SQL init routines.
* Add user land configuration file to the user's home directory.
* Move data directory to userland in home directory.
* Add "search" functionality to C, V, S, and P form browsers.
* Add "Actions" to menu.
  * Create C, V, S, or P.
  * Commit S or P.
  * Close books.
  * Spawn the database browser.
* Create the exception classes for the app with logging and dialogs.
* Add validation to the forms.
* Add logic to prompt for a save if the form has been changed.

Reports needed:
* uncommitted sales and purchases
* outstanding sales that are not complete
* balance sheet, etc
* customer sales
* vendor purchases
Move these to menu items with their own dialogs?

PLAN:
* Create a form dialog.
* Customers and Vendor forms in the notebook are browsers. If a C or V is to
  be edited, then a separate dialog is displayed. Same with Sales and Purchase
  forms.
  3.a  Add "New" and "Edit" buttons.
