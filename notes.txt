When a sale or purchase is committed, then the accounts are updated.

Inventory is automatically updated when a sale is made. (TODO)

Reports needed:
* uncommitted sales and purchases
* outstanding sales that are not complete
* balance sheet, etc
Move these to menu items with their own dialogs?

Put new sales and purchases in the menu, rather than trying to code up
new forms?

Add progress dialogs for database stuff.
